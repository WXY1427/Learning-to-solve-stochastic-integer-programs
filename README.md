# Learning-to-solve-stochastic-integer-programs

A semi-supervised learning method based on contional variational autoencoder (CVAE) for two-stage stochastic integer programs.

## Paper

Please refer to the paper: Learning Scenario Representation for Solving Two-stage Stochastic Integer Programs, International Conference on Learning RepresentationsÂ (ICLR), 2022. https://openreview.net/forum?id=06Wy2BtxXrz
Besides the semi-supervised learning method in the paper, we also provide a contrastive learning method in the file "ndp_14_22_contrastive".
